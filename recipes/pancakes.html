    <img src="../img/pancakes.jpg">
    <p>It's really quite easy to make perfect buttmilk pancakes at home. You'll find the full recipe below, but first the ingredients.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients: </strong>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the wet ingredients: </strong>Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the pancakes: </strong>dd the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are brown.</li>
    </ol>
